# Interactive Blog Frontend

This repository contains the backend component of an interactive blog based upon my journey to becoming a software engineer. The first step of my journey will begin with this project, as I learn how to correctly implement a react server, which will be deployed using AWS. I chose this stack because each framework/language appears to be the industry-standard.

# Stack
Deployment: AWS <br />
Backend/Controller: Python <br />
Database: MondoDB <br />
File System: AWS S3 <br />
